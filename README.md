User journey for Sauce Demo Test-cases.

Login Page: 

	Login Page is the index or we can say that the landing page of the website. On this page we have to enter the credentials of the website. On website we have four credentials which of them three are valid one is locked so as my first task I complete all the test cases for Login Module.

Inventory Page or Home Page: 
	
	After user login to the website using valid credentials user is redirected to the home page. On the home page we have the products. In the products we have link of there names and the image which linked to the description of the product. So on the home page I verify all the links and images so that I can validate the link is working fine and redirecting us to the correct page. Other then this on the home page we also have the Add To Cart button so I also check that the add to cart page is actually adding the product to cart or not.

Cart Page: 

	As I am adding the product to the cart so the item is added to the next page which Cart Page. So in page I automate to add all the item to cart and verify that idem added to cart successfully, other then this I also implement the remove button concept to remove the cart item.

Check Out Page:

	After the cart page if we want to buy the product then we have to click on continue on the cart item and then the next page which is Check Out page will appear. In checkout page we have to enter the first Name Last Name and Pin code and click on continue to buy the product. Other then this we can also cancel the purchase at the Check Out page I also implement that concept.


	So the assignment I almost automate the complete journey from login to buying a product.
